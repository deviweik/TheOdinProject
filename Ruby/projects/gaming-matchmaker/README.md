Gaming-Matchmaker
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to make a program that can help create gaming communities by doing
a few things:
  1. Take in users with their favorite games, rough schedule/free time, 
  quick personality quiz, interests, and commitment level.
  2. Match up groups that are likely to enjoy playing games together using
  the user data.
  3. Open a chat room that is live for 48 hours or until everyone matched 
  into the group has backed out. Generates a new group afterwards

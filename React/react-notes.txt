Library vs Framework
  Inversion of control
    Library - you are in charge of the flow of the application, you choose 
    when and where to call the library.

    Framework - framework is in charge of the flow. It tells you where you 
    can plug in your own code, but it decides when to call this code.

  Opinionated
    The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer 
    dictates how "opinionated" it is. 

    More freedom = less opinionated

Vite 
  Used to quick start React projects
  
  Minimum steps required to configure your own project and development 
  environment:
    - Package Management (NPM, Yarn)
    - Module Bundling (Webpack, Parcel)
    - Compilation (Babel)
    - React itself 

    Vite can do most of this with a single terminal command
      npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react

Default React Project Directory
  /public - static assests, i.e. images, icons, information files 

  /src - code that runs the app
    main.jsx - entry point of the application

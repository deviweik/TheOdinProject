Git
    Commits
        git add .

        git commit .

        git push

    Branches
        git branch <branch_name> 
            creates a new branch
        
        git checkout <branch_name>
            change branches
        
        git checkout -b <branch_name>
            create and change branch on one line

        git push origin <branch_name>
            push new branch to github

        git branch
            shows all current branches

        git checkout main  
            go back to main branch

        git merge <branch_name> 
            Merge the changes you made on <branch_name> into your current 
            branch (usually should be main)
        
        git branch -d <branch_name> 
            delete branch (locally) after you've merged its changes and don't need 
            it anymore. (-d will only delete after branch has been fully
            merged)

        git branch -D <branch_name> 
            If you haven't already merged the changes from a branch and 
            don't plan to, you can use this to force delete the branch.

        git push --delete origin <branch_name>
            Delete branch from remote repo on github as well.


Problem Solving
    Understand the Problem
        - Don't waste time on the wrong solution

        - Describe the problem in plain english. If you can explain a
        problem to somebody else, you understand it.

    Plan 
        Early Stage Questions
            - Will I have a user interface? What will it look like?
            What functionality will it have? Sketch it out 

            - What will the inputs be? Pulled in from a resource or 
            entered manually?

            - What are the outputs? What do they need to look like?

            - What steps are necessary to get to your output by using your
            inputs? Do you need additional resources?

    Pseudocode 
        Similar to planning step, helps to break project down into 
        actionable steps. 

        Also helps you find gaps in your plan where you may need further
        research, different tools, or more inputs.

    Divide and Conquer
        There are probably a number of small problems identified through
        planning and pseudocode that require solving. It is best to 
        approach and solve one problem at a time to piece together your
        overall solution.

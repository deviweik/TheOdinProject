Problem Solving
    Understand the Problem
        - Don't waste time on the wrong solution

        - Describe the problem in plain english. If you can explain a
        problem to somebody else, you understand it.

    Plan 
        Early Stage Questions
            - Will I have a user interface? What will it look like?
            What functionality will it have? Sketch it out 

            - What will the inputs be? Pulled in from a resource or 
            entered manually?

            - What are the outputs? What do they need to look like?

            - What steps are necessary to get to your output by using your
            inputs? Do you need additional resources?

    Pseudocode 
        Similar to planning step, helps to break project down into 
        actionable steps. 

        Also helps you find gaps in your plan where you may need further
        research, different tools, or more inputs.

    Divide and Conquer
        There are probably a number of small problems identified through
        planning and pseudocode that require solving. It is best to 
        approach and solve one problem at a time to piece together your
        overall solution.
